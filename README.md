<h2>Supplementary Documents</h2>

<h3>Inquiry</h3>
Customize my Twine story in different aspects. It contains:
<ul>
  <li>Remove the "Back" button</li>
  <li>Add a "Start" Page</li>
  <li>Add "Save" and "Continue" functions</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>ResearchPlan</h3>
Search online tutorials, and embed the revision into the project, test.

<h3>Solution</h3>
Here are some tutorials and solutions I found for each inquiry.
<br><b>Remove the "Back" button</b>
<br>https://twinery.org/forum/discussion/2931/remove-back-option-in-2-0
<br>Since Twine uses CSS style sheet, for default story mode, we could set up the 'display' property of tw-sidebar as 'none'.
However, I think this would disturb if I put any elements inside tw-sidebar. I may need to figure out other solutions if needed.

<br><b>Add a Start page</b>
This one is comparatively easy, I added a new passage and set it as the Start Passage.

<b>Add "Save" and "Continue"</b>
I think it's important to have a "Continue" button on the start page to make the whole story is more like a game/friendly, since the story would be very long.
(Although I think if there would be some "pop up" menu or floating menu, it would be better. My knowledge needs to be enhenced for reaching that level.)
Right now, since the story hasn't been extended so long, I think single saving slot is enough. I deceided to use "Bookmark" as the saving link text. I haven't found a reliable way to add a saving code block to every passage, so instead, I might manually add them every 5 passages.
